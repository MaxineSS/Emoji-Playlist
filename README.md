### Summary ###
  > Select the emoji that best describes your current feelings and _Emoji Playlist_ will recommend you songs and playlists.

### Problem ###
  > Sometimes, there are moments when it's hard to precisely describe one's feelings in words. In the app, the user chooses an emoji that best describes their feelings, and the app recommends music based on emoji values.

### Solution ###
  > Each emoji value is mapped to values of base seeds and entities. Base seeds are artists, genres and tracks. Entitites are valence, instrumentalness, dancebility, and energy. Based on the selected emoji(seeds and entities) values by the user, the app recommends music against similar artists and tracks.
